You made it to the Guides section! Now it's time to start building some cool things with alt:V using whatever programming skills you may or may not have.

If you haven't already make sure you are familiar with JavaScript.

## Learn JavaScript Fundamentals

We cannot stress this enough. You should know the fundamentals of JavaScript before continuing any further. At the very least take a look at this 10 minute video to get the basics out of the way.

There a hundreds of ways to learn JavaScript and here are some more interactive ones:

* [CodeAcademy NodeJS Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-node-js/modules/welcome-to-learn-node-js)
* [W3Schools NodeJS](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/)
  
Nobody is going to learn these for you, put in the work and you'll get results.

## Learn alt:V Fundamentals

While this video is done in TypeScript, a lot of the same concepts apply to JavaScript. 

Just without the types.
