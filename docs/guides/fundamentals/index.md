You made it to the Fundamentals section! Now it's time to start building some cool things with alt:V using whatever programming skills you may or may not have.

If you haven't already make sure you are familiar with JavaScript and have setup server infrastructure before continuing.

## Boilerplates

A boilerplate makes it so that you never have to fully setup a server from scratch. You download and follow the README to instantly deploy a server and start coding immediately.

* [alt:V JavaScript Boilerplate](https://github.com/Stuyk/altv-quickstart)

## Learn JavaScript Fundamentals

We cannot stress this enough. You should know the fundamentals of JavaScript before continuing any further. At the very least take a look at this 10 minute video to get the basics out of the way.

There a hundreds of ways to learn JavaScript and here are some more interactive ones:

* [CodeAcademy NodeJS Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-node-js/modules/welcome-to-learn-node-js)
* [W3Schools NodeJS](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/)
  
Nobody is going to learn these for you, put in the work and you'll get results.

## Learn alt:V Fundamentals

While this video is done in TypeScript, a lot of the same concepts apply to JavaScript. 

Just without the types. Otherwise, go to the next page to see a text version of the fundamentals.
